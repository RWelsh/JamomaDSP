Jamoma DSP
Digital Signal Processing library built on the Jamoma Foundation API
_________________________________________________________________


Introduction
The Jamoma DSP Library is an open source, cross-platform, C++ programming layer for creating dynamically-bound objects optimized for realtime processing contexts.  It the basis of commercial products such as Tap.Tools, Jade, and Hipno, and is used by other open source projects such as Jamoma Modular.


Features
- Rapid development
- Self-documenting and clear code-structure
- Optimized for speed, including processing by vector


Installing
