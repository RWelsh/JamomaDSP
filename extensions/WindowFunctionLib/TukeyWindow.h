/**	This implements the Tukey window function described here:
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Window_function_(Tukey;_alpha_%3D_0.5).png
 This is alternate implementation of what Roads (1996 p 170, 2001 p 88) typically refers to as a Gaussian window.
 It is easier to ensure that x and y values will scale properly with this formula as opposed to the one given by Roads.
 
 Where 0. <= x <= 1. and 0. <= mFade <= 0.5:
 y	= 0.5 * (1 + cos ( pi * ((mFade * x) - 1)))				: for the attack
	= 1														: for the sustain
	= 0.5 * (1 + cos ( pi * ((mFade * x) - mFade + 1)))		: for the release
